# CoinGrabber
The initial design is a blank board that has coins that randomly spawn and the player, illustrated by a circle with name in the circle, collects these coins. The player with the most coins wins the game and will be tallied up in a function called points. The movements are turn based and the player will control their objects with single input. The game will keep a count of how many coins are collected, and the game will end when all coins are collected. The wins and losses will also be shown to the player.
